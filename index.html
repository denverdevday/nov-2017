It is currently the language of choice for popular front end frameworks like Angular and Ionic, but did you know you can also take advantage of TypeScript on the server using Node? In this session we will take a look at how TypeScript provides the features and flexibility for writing first class web applications on the server as well as the client. On the server, we will go over setting up a Node application to use TypeScript and a new web framework called NestJS, which utilizes TypeScript and Express, and will make any ASP.Net dev feel right at home. Then we will build out the client using the popular Angular framework and show how our two TypeScript applications can share code and communicate with one another. To wrap things up, we will publish our Node and Angular app to Azure to see how quickly we can get a full stack TypeScript app running in the cloud.</p>

However, the reality is you still need to secure your application as a whole. In this session you'll learn about aspects of security that the client side has to participate in, including CSRF/XSRF, XSS, and CORS. You'll learn all this primarily in the context of using ASP.NET for your back end, Identity Server 4 for authentication and how to leverage JavaScript constructs to managing the Http service to get your auth token added to your back-end calls.</p>
